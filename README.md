# horizontal-scaling-with-kafka

## Introduction

Many organizations face scaling issues when dealing with high data load on Kafka topics. These issues are related to scaling the rate at which producers write messages to the topic as well as the rate at which your consumer application can process them.
This asset provides application templates for producing and consuming messages from Kafka topics using various Kafka connector configurations in order to meet the increasing producer/consumer processing load in a multi-threaded model.
